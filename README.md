# TRIVIA API

## Project Description

This documentation describes the resources that make up the Trivia API.The trivia api is an open source Rest api that allows developers to display and create quizzes and online trivia's through it. This repository also comes with a frontend application that allows developers to demo its abilities. Through this api you can:

- Retrieve all questions categories or;
- Filter questions based on their category
- Add new questions, their answers and specify their category and level of difficulty
- Delete questions
- Search for questions via a substring of that question
- Play the quiz game

It is advised that you run this project in a virtual environment. Follow the instructions in the [python documentation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) to set up your virtual environment.

#### Installing Dependencies

- Backend Dependency installation
  Follow the instructions below to install the project dependencies with Python's [preferred installer program (PIP)](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

  1. Change the working directory in your terminal to the backend directory
     > cd backend/
  2. Enter the following command
     > pip install -r requirements.txt

- Frontend Dependency installation
  1. Change the working directory in your terminal to the frontend directory > cd frontend/
  2. Enter the following command > npm install

#### Setup the Database
